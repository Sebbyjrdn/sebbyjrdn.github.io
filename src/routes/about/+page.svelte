        <p class="text-justify">I studied at St. Joseph College from elementary to senior high school, where my interest in technology began to develop, even though Information Technology was not my main focus at the time. Initially, Information Technology wasn't my first choice, but as I explored the field, I discovered a passion for it that I never expected, leading me to embrace it wholeheartedly.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-justify">Starting this journey with little knowledge of computers has been challenging, but Iâ€™ve grown to enjoy the learning process. Every day brings new challenges and opportunities, and I'm excited to expand my skills in the world of technology.</p>
